# Convert sectors to one-hot encoding and multiply by transaction amount for weighted interactions

# Note: This code focuses on demonstrating the integration of all three models.
# In practice, further steps are needed for a complete recommendation system, such as:
# - Transforming predictions from model-based CF into actionable recommendations
# - Combining recommendations from all three models into a final recommendation list per user
# - Evaluating and tuning the models based on performance metrics relevant to recommendation systems
