Certainly! Below is a consolidated code snippet that includes creating a UserForm with a TextBox for the customer ID input, a CommandButton to trigger the search, and the VBA macro to search for the customer ID in a specified column. This example assumes customer IDs are stored in column A of a sheet named "Sheet1". The code will display a message box indicating whether the customer was found and on which row.

### Step 1: UserForm Code
First, ensure you've added a UserForm named `UserForm1`, a TextBox named `TextBox1`, and a CommandButton named `CommandButton1`. In the VBA Editor, double-click `UserForm1` to open its code window and add:

```vba
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    SearchCustomer
End Sub
```

### Step 2: Module Code
In a new module, paste the following code:

```vba
Public Sub SearchCustomer()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim searchRange As Range
    Dim foundCell As Range
    Dim customerID As String
    
    ' Adjust these to match your setup
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change "Sheet1" to your sheet's name
    Set searchRange = ws.Range("A:A") ' Assuming customer IDs are in column A
    
    customerID = UserForm1.TextBox1.Value ' Assuming your UserForm is named UserForm1 and your TextBox is TextBox1
    
    Set foundCell = searchRange.Find(What:=customerID, LookIn:=xlValues)
    
    If Not foundCell Is Nothing Then
        ' Display full row data or do something with it
        MsgBox "Customer found in row " & foundCell.Row ' Example action
        ' Here, you could also write code to display all the details in the UserForm or elsewhere
    Else
        MsgBox "Customer ID not found."
    End If
End Sub
```

### Step 3: Showing the UserForm
To show the UserForm from Excel, add a button on your sheet and assign this macro to it:

```vba
Sub ShowSearchForm()
    UserForm1.Show
End Sub
```

To add this macro:
1. Go back to Excel.
2. On the Developer tab, click "Insert" and choose "Button" under Form Controls.
3. Draw the button on your sheet.
4. Assign the `ShowSearchForm` macro to this button.

When you click this button in Excel, `UserForm1` will appear. Enter a customer ID in `TextBox1` and click the command button to search. A message box will inform you if the customer was found and on which row.

This script is a basic example to get you started. Depending on your needs, you might want to expand it to display more detailed information about the search results directly on the UserForm or elsewhere in the workbook.
