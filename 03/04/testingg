Hi Pranati,

Could you please confirm:
	1.	From when to when is the data available in the backup table?
	2.	In the Captured Response History table, from when onwards is the correct data available?

I am currently using data from April 2 till now. Should I combine both of these tables, or not? I need this clarification as soon as possible to proceed.

Additionally, for GupShup response data:
	•	Going forward, till how many days should the data be available?
	•	What is the exact time period for which we will receive the data?
	•	If you are creating any backup files, what are your scheduled timelines and what is the procedure at your end?

Every time it becomes difficult for us to check data issues manually. If we are aware of these details in advance, it will help us plan and proceed accordingly.

Looking forward to your detailed confirmation.
