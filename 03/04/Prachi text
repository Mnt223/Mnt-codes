Hi Smriti,

As discussed, I have already refreshed the base from my end. The campaign dashboard is scheduled to be refreshed tomorrow morning between 9-11 AM, as we have aligned on multiple times.

I have consistently been proactive in responding and have shared all necessary emails related to the campaign dashboard. Since the refresh is scheduled for tomorrow, there was no immediate need to update the executives today, which is why I didn’t forward the email. As always, I verify the numbers and formatting after every refresh before sharing the final update with everyone.

Additionally, as per our discussion, I was supposed to receive the mapping on the 4th but only received it on the 17th, which was already past the scheduled refresh timeline for that day.

Alongside this task, I have also been managing my regular BAU and ad-hoc activities in parallel to ensure all deliverables are met without any delays.

Subject: Follow-up on Activity MIS and Dashboard Discussion

Dear Anil,

I hope you are doing well.

As we discussed last Wednesday, I had shared the initial version of the Activity MIS, and we explored further enhancements for the dashboard. Since I was on leave from last Thursday, I will be working on those additions today.

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could schedule a meeting on Tuesday so that we can further discuss the dashboard and align on the next steps.






















Here’s a more professional and polite version of the email:

Subject: Assistance Required for Sales MI Dashboard, Sales Revenue, and TM1 Reporting

Hi Kaustov,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to follow up regarding a few points:
	1.	Sales MI Dashboard – We are currently using DBMIS, Balance Growth, and Activity MI. As per my discussion with Anil, it was confirmed that the planner file is provided by you. Could you please help in getting the planner file, along with its location and update frequency?
	2.	Sales Revenue – As almost 80% of the product updates have been completed with the new logic, there are still pending updates for TPSA, CC, and PILs for Digital. The discussions regarding CC are still ongoing with Bishit. Please let me know if any further inputs are required from my side.
	3.	TM1 Reporting – Since this month’s reporting has not been published yet, could you please guide me on how we should proceed, considering that the product logic is still incomplete in sales revenue? Your guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your response. Please let me know if any clarification is needed.

Subject: Re: KT Session Request

Dear [Teammate’s Name],

Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the opportunity to be part of this KT session. However, at the moment, my bandwidth is fully occupied with existing deliverables that are critical and time-sensitive.

Taking on additional tasks or participating in the KT session would require me to deprioritize some of these urgent commitments, which is not feasible at this stage. Given the current workload, I would like to discuss with [Manager’s Name] how we can best manage these priorities while ensuring all critical deadlines are met.

[Manager’s Name], I would appreciate your guidance on how to navigate this so that we can find a feasible way forward. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

This keeps your tone professional and constructive while clearly communicating your constraints. Let me know if you’d like any refinements!

Subject: RE: EXTERNAL – OSF Failure

Hi Kaja,

The LOR file shared for February 25 had the location as “WAAL TPSA” instead of “MUM TPSA”, “MUM, TPSA”, or “TPSA, MUM”. This discrepancy is the reason for the different OSF names.

Regarding the failure, we received a response from the InMoment Team confirming that the failure information was shared on February 14th, late at night, at 11:07 PM. As I was on sick leave on Monday, I connected with you on Tuesday to discuss the issue. On the same day, I retriggered the file and also forwarded the failure email to you.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification.

Best regards,
Prachi Jain

This version keeps it professional, concise, and clear. Let me know if you need any further adjustments.
