Subject: Prioritization and Bandwidth Challenges

Hi Kinnari and Souvik,

As I am working on both Campaigns and the BI part, I wanted to highlight the ongoing bandwidth challenges that I have been raising for the past couple of months and seek clarity on prioritization.

Below are the key projects and deliverables I am currently handling this week:
	1.	HML Dashboard UAT: The dashboard has been published, and after testing, it needs to be pushed to production.
	2.	Branch Initiatives: This has been recently assigned to me, and I will be working on it.
	3.	Sales Revenue: While the coding logic for some products is completed, a few are still pending. Due to bandwidth constraints, I haven’t been able to connect with stakeholders and Sriram to finalize the logic. This needs to be completed before the 10th, as this month’s MI will incorporate the new logic.
	4.	Campaign Dashboard: Frequent version updates and additions are required. For the next update, I need to dedicate the whole next week, and I plan to deliver the updated version to stakeholders by the 10th. Additionally, for the costing part, Smriti will provide the logic next week.
	5.	Trainings: There are multiple scheduled training sessions next week.
	6.	Daily and Monthly BAU: Managing regular BAU tasks for this week.

Given the workload and upcoming deadlines, I would appreciate any support in prioritizing these tasks. Please let me know how we can manage this efficiently.

Looking forward to your inputs.

Best,
[Your Name]
